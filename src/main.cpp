 * match the "target" in our *binding.gyp*. Using NODE_GYP_MODULE_NAME ensures
 * that the argument will be correct, as long as the module is built with
 * node-gyp (which is the usual way of building modules). The second argument
 * points to the function to invoke. The function must not be namespaced.
